/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in users table RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - The existing admin policies on the users table cause infinite recursion
    - They query the same users table they're applied to, creating a loop

  2. Solution
    - Drop the problematic admin policies that cause recursion
    - Keep only the simple "Users can read own profile" policy
    - Admin functionality can be handled at the application level

  3. Security
    - Users can only read their own profile data
    - This prevents the infinite recursion while maintaining security

-- Drop the problematic admin policies that cause infinite recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can read all users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all users" ON users;

-- Keep only the safe policy for users to read their own profile
-- This policy already exists and is correct: "Users can read own profile"

-- Add a simple policy for users to update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON users
